# Hi, I'm Andrew Davis

Cloud Architect and Data Engineer with 10+ years steering science-forward, mission-critical
programs across government agencies including NASA, DoD, and FDA. Experience
delivering cloud-native, massively distributed data platforms on hyperscaler platforms,
blending petabyte scale lakehouses, event-driven ETL, and knowledge-graph pipelines with
DevSecOps-grade CI/CD and MLOps. Equally at home hardening VPC/IAM baselines,
running cost-benefit trade studies, or guiding cross-functional teams and stakeholders, I turn
complex mission objectives into secure, high-impact solutions that drive innovation in
regulated environments

##  About Me

Expanding boundaries is a pillar of my outlook on life. I find enjoyment in the balance of pushing myself physically and mentally to attain new heights— whether it be in the literal sense, hiking one of Colorado’s many 14ers with Burke, or in the abstract, learning about the nuances climate has on the caramelization characteristics of coffee beans. I'm motivated by an insatiable curiosity that has led me to become an avid learner and explorer of the minute details of the world.
